# yl-11ty

Just another [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) starter kit.

## Start building

You're going to need `node` and `npm`.

-   `npm install` to install dependencies
-   `npm start` (or `npm run dev`) to spin up a live reloading local dev server
-   `npm run build` to create an optimized build

## What's what?

### HTML

HTML is created from [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templates, but since 11ty is awesome, you can also use Nunjucks in Markdown files.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

This would not exist without the work of some very talented people.
