# yl-11ty

Just another [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) starter kit.

## Start building

-   `npm install` to install dependencies
-   `npm start` (or `npm run dev`) to spin up a live reloading local dev server
-   `npm run build` to create an optimized build

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

This starter kit would not exist without the work of some very talented people.
